    - TextBlob:Offline . Uses textblob for spell correction.
    - Scratch: Custom spell checker built from scratch.

    * Remove non alphanumeric.
    * Option to add custom rules. Custom make a child class with base class 'RULE' and override process function

# TO Do:
* In scratch engine:
    * the used corpus is small and the vocabulary is limited.For practical purposed we would need to choose dataset based on use case. For social media applications,https://www.english-corpora.org/tv/ is a good option as the language is informal and contains several slangs.
    * Google has released Web n-grams @ https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T13 . This contains many bigrams, trigrams , 4 grams & 5-grams with their correponding frequency.
